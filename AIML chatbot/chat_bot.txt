Artificial intelligence chat bots are easy to write in Python with the AIML package.

AIML is a form of XML that defines rules for matching patterns and determining responses.
(in simple words if the entered message from the user matches with the patterns we have mentioned then our response will be whatever is written in the template)

Standard Startup File:(standard file std-startup.xml)
This serves as the main entry point.
Here we specify that if the pattern matches 'load aiml b' then load basic_chat.aiml file.
(and in basic_chat.aiml we have the talk wla stuff)

basic_chat.aiml file:
now category is like a unit cell in aiml
So for different messages from the user we can create any number of categories.
In each category, we have an expected message from the user(pattern) and its coressponding desired message we wish to print(template) 

A simple python program to create aiml object.
In that we learn ONLY std-startup(which then loads the rest of the aiml files).
So in case later on we need to add anything, wwe do it in std-startup file

Speeding up brain load:
(used dwhen we have a large number of aiml files)
learning those files on subsequent times will take time.So to save time, we load all those aiml files in the brain.

tuo baically es assignment kai liye we need to :
std_startup.xml
basic_chat.aiml
create_aiml_obj.py(or test.py)
